## Zonal Statistics

This QGIS plugin shows statistics of point features grouped by a polygon layer, where each feature represents a region. These statistics can be viewed either as a table or on a graph, but can also be appended to the polygon layer as a new field.

Polygon layer has a constraint, that second column (`[1]`) must contain names of features.
